text=common mode noise,
description={For high-bandwidth interfaces, common mode noise is the potential difference between the signal return (shield) connection and the local structure ground. For low-bandwidth interfaces, common mode noise is the sum of the potential differences between (i) the non-inverting connection and local structure ground, and (ii) the inverting connection and local structure ground.
